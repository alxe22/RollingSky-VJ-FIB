# RollingSky

RollingSky project is a clone of the popular game published by [Cheetah Games](https://cheetahgames.cmcm.com/) in 2016, where the main objective for the player is to avoid obstacles by controlling a speedy ball. The game, programmed with Unity engine, C# and using VS Code and Atom as the main IDE for the project, features three different levels. The first level follows a similar esthetic than [Tron: Legacy](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron:_Legacy), the sc-fi Disney film released in 2010. The second level was inspired by the iconic Nintendo franchise [Super Mario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario) with its colorful world and iconic villains. The third level was a small tribute to one of our favorite anime series the world have ever seen: [Dragon Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball).
